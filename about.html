					<h2>Welcome!</h2>

					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>  Among the natural resources that are located in the district of Maca, are mainly, the Sabancaya volcano, and the Ampato volcano. The first of these volcanoes has a height of 5, 976 m.a.s.l., and in spite of being an active volcano, it presents trekking routes to access it. The path that leads to the top of the volcano, takes 4 days to complete, and despite the long walk, it does not involve major difficulties.</p>

					<p> The Sabancaya is also important for tourism, because of its value as Apu Tutelar, that is, an Andean deity venerated since time immemorial that, to date, still has followers. Its quality of deity, makes the resource is also an archaeological asset, since it presents, in itself, archaeological evidence of sacrifices, both human, and not, that were made years ago, to calm their anger.</p>
					<p> The second of these volcanoes, but not less important, is the Ampato. The Ampato volcano is a snowy volcano, which like the previous one, was and is considered an Andean deity, or apu. The volcano is important, at a historical and archaeological level, because of the discovery of the so-called "Mummy Juanita", at its summit, a proof of the pre-Hispanic human sacrifices. It is also important because of its height, which is greater than that of the previous volcano, attracts intrepid tourists, interested in climbing its walls to conquer its summit. Unlike the previous volcano, the Ampato not only has dirt trails, but also snow trails, which is why both for trekking, as for climbing on ice and rock, that is a tourist point of greater difficulty than the Sabancaya.</p>

					<p> Among the archaeological resources that can be found in the district of Maca, besides the vestiges of the volcanoes, there are places like the Ruins of Pachamarca. The ruins of Pachamarca, are interesting for the similarities that present their structures, with the constructions Chavín; also, they call the attention for the path that is necessary to follow to know the resource, and that offers in itself a trekking route of up to two hours.</p>

					<p> The Archaeological Center of Choquetico, also known as Peña Blanca, is also an archaeological resource of Maca, which stands out for being a funerary complex where the tombs are hanging. The visit to Peña Blanca must be done with the precautions of the case, since there are no modern paths to access the resource, and you must follow the routes drawn by the ancestors.</p>

					<p> In Maca, some constructions are also interesting, as is the case of the Temple of Santa Ana, which dates from 1760 and is now considered a National Historical Monument. This Catholic construction houses the effigy of the Virgin of Santa Ana, who is the patron saint of Maca, which is celebrated with great pomp every August 2nd</p>
